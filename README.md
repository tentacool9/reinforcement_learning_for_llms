Reinforcement Learning For LLMS

Since I can't recreate deepseek on my own PC I decided to learn the reinforcement learning mathematics and implement them myself using a different task than language modeling.
If you want to understand something you need to do it yourself.

So in this notebook I build up RL from Q-learning on Tic-Tac-Toe to deepseek GRPO on Cartpole

*Table Of Contents:*
1. Tic Tac Toe - Two agents play tic tac toe against one another
  a. Q-Learning
  b. Monte Carlo Learning
2. Cartpole
  a. Policy Gradient - REINFORCE
  b. Actor Critic
  c. PPO
  d. GRPO
