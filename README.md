Reinforcement Learning For LLMS

Since I can't recreate deepseek on my own PC I decided to learn the reinforcement learning mathematics and implement them myself using a different task than language modeling.
If you want to understand something you need to do it yourself.

So in this notebook I build up RL from Q-learning on Tic-Tac-Toe to deepseek GRPO on Cartpole

*Table Of Contents:*
-Tic Tac Toe - Two agents play tic tac toe against one another
--Q-Learning
--Monte Carlo Learning
-Cartpole
--Policy Gradient - REINFORCE
--Actor Critic
--PPO
--GRPO
